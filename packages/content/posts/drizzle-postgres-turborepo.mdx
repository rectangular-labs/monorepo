<Callout type="note">
Monorepos shine when database types are shared between API and UI packages.
</Callout>

## Setup outline

- Define schema in a `packages/db` workspace using Drizzle.
- Generate types and export a `createDb` factory.
- Consume from `packages/api` and keep Zod/ArkType schemas in sync.

## Migrations

Use Drizzle Kit to generate and apply migrations, and wire scripts via your root workspace.
