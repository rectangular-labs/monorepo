<Callout type="info">
Passkeys remove passwords from your auth flow using public-key cryptography powered by WebAuthn.
</Callout>

Passkeys are discoverable credentials stored by the OS and synced across devices. They bind authentication to the device and user presence (biometrics or PIN), improving both security and UX.

## What you need to know

- Registration creates a key pair. The private key never leaves the device.
- Authentication proves possession of the private key with a signed challenge.
- Relying parties (your app) validate the signature with the public key.

## Implementation steps

1. Feature-detect WebAuthn and platform authenticator availability.
2. On signup, call `navigator.credentials.create` with a `publicKey` challenge from your server.
3. Persist the credential ID and public key on your server.
4. On login, call `navigator.credentials.get` with a server-issued challenge and verify the assertion.
