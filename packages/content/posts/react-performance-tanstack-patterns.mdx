<Callout type="tip">
Focus on the highest-impact bottlenecks: network waterfalls, re-render churn, and long lists.
</Callout>

## Key tactics

- Cache aggressively with `@tanstack/react-query` and avoid duplicate requests.
- Co-locate route-driven data with `@tanstack/react-router` loaders.
- Virtualize large lists with `@tanstack/react-virtual`.
- Memoize stable props and avoid recreating functions on every render.

## Example workflow

1. Profile with the React DevTools Profiler and the Performance panel.
2. Annotate slow components; add `memo` and `useMemo` where it matters.
3. Move data fetching into Query with smart keys and `staleTime`.
4. Virtualize any list over ~200 items.
