<Callout type="note">
This is a practical, soup-to-nuts system for keyword research you can run monthly. It favors business impact over vanity metrics and bakes in modern SERP realities (zero-click, AI overviews, E-E-A-T).
</Callout>

## Who this is for

If you plan, write, or own performance for organic content (founders, marketers, PMs, SEOs, and technical writers), this guide gives you a repeatable process to go from vague topics to prioritized, publish-ready outlines.

## Outcomes you'll produce

- A de-duplicated keyword universe organized into topics and subtopics
- An intent-aware content map (hub, spokes, comparisons, programmatic pages)
- A quarterly roadmap ranked by impact, confidence, and effort

## Step 1 — Define audiences, jobs, and constraints

- Identify 2-3 primary audiences and their “jobs to be done”.
- Clarify your business model, primary conversions, and average deal value.
- Note constraints: domain authority, publishing cadence, design/dev support.

The biggest keyword research failure is aiming at queries your site can't win yet. Calibrate ambition to your current authority and resources.
</Callout>

## Step 2 — Build a rich seed list

Start with what you own, then expand outward.

- Owned data: Google Search Console, site search logs, sales/support notes, CRM questions.
- Competitors: top pages, sitemap, category trees, comparison pages, alternative pages.
- Marketplaces/directories: G2/Capterra categories, GitHub topics, Reddit megathreads.
- Knowledge graphs: Wikipedia category trees, Wikidata entities.

Tip: Add common modifiers to every seed to force breadth: `how to`, `best`, `vs`, `alternatives`, `template`, `checklist`, `for [role]`, `near me` (local), `pricing`, `examples`, `tools`, `ideas`.

## Step 3 — Expand and normalize

Use multiple sources to reduce bias:

- Google: Autocomplete, People Also Ask, Related Searches
- Keyword platforms: Ahrefs, Semrush, Moz, LowFruits
- SERP APIs: DataForSEO, SerpAPI (for programmatic enrichment)
- Community: Reddit, Stack Overflow, Discord/Slack FAQs

Normalize variants (singular/plural, hyphenation, UK/US spelling) and deduplicate. Keep the raw term for reference and a canonical “normalized keyword” for grouping.

## Step 4 — Collect the right metrics

Track metrics that map to business value, not just vanity volume:

- Search volume and clicks (prefer clicks when available)
- Difficulty/competition (relative to your domain authority)
- CPC (a proxy for commercial value), plus estimated conversion potential
- SERP features (news, videos, shopping, featured snippets, AI overviews)
- Seasonality and freshness sensitivity

## Step 5 — Infer intent from the SERP

Open the SERP for a sample of terms in each cluster and classify intent by what actually ranks:

- Informational: guides, how-tos, definitions, checklists
- Commercial investigation: comparisons, alternatives, best-of lists, templates
- Transactional: product, pricing, signup, demo pages
- Navigational: branded queries

Also note page types (blog vs docs vs product), content depth, and angle. This tells you what to create and how strong it must be to compete.

## Step 6 — Cluster by meaning and SERP overlap

Group keywords into topics where the same page could rank for most members. Two robust methods:

- Manual + rules: group by normalized keyword + intent; merge when SERP top results overlap heavily.
- Programmatic: compute pairwise similarity (n-grams, embeddings) and cluster; then validate with SERP overlap.

Outcome: Each cluster has a canonical topic, representative keywords, intent, and initial page type.

## Step 7 — Prioritize with a simple scoring model

Score each cluster with an ICE-style model tailored to SEO:

- Impact: traffic potential x conversion potential
- Confidence: authority fit, SERP difficulty, your differentiation
- Effort: content depth, design/assets, engineering needs

You can also use a KOB-style heuristic: \( (traffic\ potential \times business\ value) / (difficulty \times effort) \) to surface quick wins.

## Step 8 — Map clusters to content types

- Hubs: pillar guides that capture broad intent and link to spokes
- Spokes: deep dives targeting subtopics and long-tail modifiers
- Comparisons: `X vs Y`, `X alternatives`, `[Best] [Category] for [Role]`
- Programmatic: templated pages powered by structured data
- Product/docs: solution, features, implementation guides for bottom-funnel

Ensure strong internal linking: hub → spokes, spokes ↔ spokes (same topic), and contextual links to product/docs as appropriate.

## Step 9 — Outline with on-SERP inputs

Build your outline from:

- Top-ranking H2/H3 patterns (but differentiate)
- People Also Ask questions
- Related searches and autocomplete expansions
- Entity coverage: include core concepts, synonyms, and common tools

Add a brief POV section (why your approach is better/unique), and plan any assets: diagrams, tables, calculators.

## Step 10 — Ship, measure, and iterate

- Publish and request indexing.
- In Google Search Console, monitor the page's queries, impressions, clicks, and position by device and country.
- Watch for cannibalization (multiple URLs ranking for the same queries); consolidate or re-target.
- Refresh content when intent shifts, new SERP features appear, or the page stalls.

## Advanced playbooks

### Topical authority sprints

- Choose a narrow subtopic and publish the hub + 6-12 spokes in 2-4 weeks.
- Ensure tight internal linking and consistent entity coverage.

### Programmatic SEO responsibly

- Start with high-quality structured data (catalogs, datasets). Avoid thin pages.
- Handle deduplication and canonicalization; use unique value props per page.
- Gate scale behind quality thresholds (content length, unique fields, demand).

### International and local nuance

- Local: incorporate geo-modifiers and local SERP features; build location pages only with unique value.
- International: adapt to language and intent differences; avoid 1:1 translations.

### Zero-click and AI overviews

- Some terms brand build but won't click. Decide intentionally whether to target.
- Structure content to win rich results where it matters (lists, how-tos, FAQs), without over-optimizing.
