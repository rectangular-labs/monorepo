          We&apos;re Winston and Aaron â€” an engineer and a strategist who
          actually build and rank sites ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Winston spent 5 years in Silicon Valley building automation systems
          for startups. Now he uses that same engineering precision to automate
          growth processes and get results fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aaron, trained in law at Oxford, knows how to make words rank.
          He&apos;s taken multiple pages to the top of Google through structure,
          clarity, and intent-driven writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, we&apos;ve already ranked sites from 0 to 1,000+ organic
          visitors in weeks and we&apos;re applying the same system to our
          clients.
