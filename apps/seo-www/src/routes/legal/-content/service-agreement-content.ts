### 4.4 Data Processing Agreement

To the extent Fluid Posts will Process Customer Data subject to applicable "Data Protection Law," as such term is defined in the Fluid Posts Data Processing Agreement located at https://fluidposts.com/legal/data-processing-agreement (the "Data Processing Agreement"), in the provision of the Services to Customer, each Party will comply with its obligations in the Data Processing Agreement, which is incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

## 5. Customer Obligations

Customer is responsible for its Customer Data, including its content and accuracy, and will comply with applicable Laws when using the Services, including those that apply to Customer Data.

The Services may support integration with third-party platforms, add-ons, services, or products not provided by Fluid Posts ("Third-Party Platforms"). Use of any Third-Party Platforms integrated with or made available through the Services is subject to Customer's agreement with the relevant provider and not this Agreement. Fluid Posts does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Platforms, including their security, functionality, operation, availability, or interoperability with the Fluid Posts Technology or how the Third-Party Platforms or their providers use Customer Data. By enabling a Third-Party Platform to interact with the Fluid Posts Technology, Customer authorizes Fluid Posts to access and exchange Customer Data with such Third-Party Platform on Customer's behalf. To the extent an integration with a Third-Party Platform requires that Fluid Posts use Customer's access credentials for such Third-Party Platform, Customer: (a) agrees to provide such credentials, (b) represents and warrants that Customer has all necessary rights to provide such credentials, and (c) authorizes Fluid Posts to use such credentials on Customer's behalf in connection with the provision of the Services.

### 14.1 Definition

"Confidential Information" means information disclosed to the receiving Party ("Recipient") under this Agreement that is designated by the disclosing Party ("Discloser") as proprietary or confidential or that should be reasonably understood to be proprietary or confidential due to its nature or the circumstances of its disclosure. Fluid Posts' Confidential Information includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Fluid Posts Technology (including any technical or performance information about the Fluid Posts Technology). Customer's Confidential Information includes Customer Data.

### 14.2 Obligations

As Recipient, each Party will: (a) hold Confidential Information in confidence and implement reasonable measures to prevent its disclosure to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement, including Section 4.2 (Use of Customer Data); and (b) only use Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement. At Discloser's request, Recipient will delete all Confidential Information, except, in the case where Fluid Posts is the Recipient, Fluid Posts may retain the Customer's Confidential Information to the extent required to continue to provide the Fluid Posts Technology as contemplated by this Agreement. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors, and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Fluid Posts, the subcontractors referenced in Section 18.8), provided it remains responsible for their compliance with this Section 14 and they are bound by written agreements (or, in the case of professional advisers like attorneys and accountants, ethical duties) imposing confidentiality and non-use obligations no less protective than this Section 14.

## 15. Required Disclosures

Nothing in this Agreement prohibits either Party from making disclosures, including of Customer Data and other Confidential Information, if required by Law, subpoena, or court order, provided (if permitted by Law) it notifies the other Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.

## 16. Trials and Betas

If Customer receives access to Fluid Posts Technology or features thereof on a free or trial basis or as an alpha, beta, or early access offering ("Trials and Betas"), use is permitted only for Customer's internal evaluation during the period designated by Fluid Posts (or if not designated, 30 days). Trials and Betas are optional and either Party may terminate Trials and Betas at any time for any reason. Trials and Betas may be inoperable, incomplete, or include features that Fluid Posts may never release, and their features and performance information are Fluid Posts' Confidential Information. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT, Fluid Posts PROVIDES NO WARRANTY, INDEMNITY, OR SUPPORT FOR TRIALS AND BETAS, AND ITS LIABILITY FOR TRIALS AND BETAS WILL NOT EXCEED US$50.
