> **For AI Agents:** This mind map is your primary knowledge index. Read overview nodes [1-5] first, then follow links [N] to find what you need. Always reference node IDs. When you encounter bugs, document your attempts in relevant nodes. When you make changes, update outdated nodes immediately—especially overview nodes since they're your springboard. Add new nodes only for genuinely new concepts. Keep it compact (20-50 nodes typical). The mind map wraps every task: consult it, rely on it, update it.

[1] **Repository Overview** - Rectangular Labs is a TypeScript Turborepo that combines multiple web apps and shared packages into one deployable system for SEO workflows, content operations, and marketing surfaces [2][4][5]. The current architecture centers on `apps/seo` for the product, `packages/api-seo` for oRPC endpoints and Cloudflare workflows, and `packages/db` for Drizzle schemas plus operations [6][9][11]. The strategy-first model is actively implemented in schema, routes, and workflows, with deeper design rationale tracked in the architecture doc [13][14][15][23].

[2] **Monorepo and Tooling Spine** - Workspace boundaries are declared in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `tooling/*`), and root scripts in `package.json` orchestrate build, dev, DB commands, lint, format, and type checks across the graph [1][22]. The stack uses `turbo`, `pnpm`, TypeScript 5, Biome, and Vitest, with dotenvx-based env management and Cloudflare-compatible app runtimes [21][22]. Package-level scripts generally compile with `tsc` or `tsup`, while app-level scripts decrypt env and run TanStack Start via Vite [4][5][6].

[3] **End-to-End Request/Data Flow** - Browser requests enter TanStack Start routes in each app, then API calls from app clients use `@rectangular-labs/api-seo/client` or server client helpers to hit `/api/rpc/*` [4][6][9]. The API layer validates input/output with ArkType, applies auth/org middleware, and delegates persistence to `packages/db/src/operations` helpers that return `Result` objects [10][12][18]. Async work is kicked to task/workflow providers and later polled through task status APIs, with results feeding strategy/content views and snapshots [14][15][16].

[4] **Application Surfaces and Routing** - The repo has three primary TanStack Start apps (`apps/seo`, `apps/www`, `apps/seo-www`) with file-based routing and generated route trees [1][6][7][8]. `apps/seo` contains authenticated organization/project routes, onboarding, content tabs, settings, and strategy detail/list pages under nested `_authed` and `$param` folders [6][13]. `apps/www` and `apps/seo-www` serve marketing/docs/blog/legal content and separate brand narratives while still sharing workspace packages for UI and content plumbing [7][8][19].

[5] **Backend Service Architecture** - API behavior is composed from `packages/api-core` and domain-specific packages (`api-seo`, `api-user-vm`, `task`, `db`, integrations), giving a layered model of handlers, context, routes, operations, and workflow execution [1][9][10]. `api-core` provides reusable handler/link utilities for RPC, OpenAPI, WebSocket RPC, CORS, and request/response header plugins [9][18]. `api-seo` is the main domain API, while `task` and workflow bindings support long-running generation, planning, onboarding, and strategy execution [15][16][20].

[6] **SEO Product App (`apps/seo`)** - `apps/seo` is the operational UI for organizations and projects, with route groups for onboarding, dashboard/content, settings, and strategies [4][13][14]. API access is centralized in `apps/seo/src/lib/api.ts`, which chooses server or browser clients and integrates TanStack Query utilities for data fetching [3][9]. Server routes `/api/rpc/$` create per-request API context then dispatch to the shared RPC handler, making app and API boundaries explicit but colocated [9][10].

[7] **Main Marketing App (`apps/www`)** - `apps/www` is a broader marketing/docs/blog surface for Rectangular Labs, containing marketing routes, docs routes, and blog/RSS endpoints [4][19]. It shares the app/runtime conventions of the repo (TanStack Start + Vite + decrypted env local files) but is structurally content-centric rather than operations-centric [2][21]. This app acts as brand and documentation frontage that complements, but does not replace, product workflows in `apps/seo` [1][6].

[8] **SEO Marketing App (`apps/seo-www`)** - `apps/seo-www` is a dedicated marketing site for the SEO product with campaign-oriented landing routes, legal pages, referral paths, and blog/search endpoints [4][7]. Its route components are organized around narrative variants (founders/original/seo-experts) while still using shared workspace utilities and content patterns [19][21]. It should be kept aligned with product messaging as strategy-first UX evolves in the main app [6][13][23].

[9] **API Route Composition (`packages/api-seo`)** - `packages/api-seo/src/routes/index.ts` lazily composes route modules (`project`, `chat`, `task`, `content`, `strategy`, `integrations`, auth subroutes) into a single router tree [5][10]. Domain routes use `base`, `protectedBase`, and `withOrganizationIdBase` middleware chains, then validate with ArkType and DB-derived schemas [10][18]. The strategy route family (`routes/strategy.ts`) now drives list/get/create/update/phase mutations and is the key bridge between UI strategy actions and workflow kickoff [13][14][16].

[10] **API Context and Middleware** - `createApiContext` wires DB, auth handler, buckets, KV, scheduler, and workflow bindings into typed request context, then oRPC middleware enriches it with session/user and logging/async storage capabilities [5][9][16]. `protectedBase` enforces authenticated requests; `withOrganizationIdBase` additionally requires active organization and is reused across organization-scoped routes [9][14]. This context model keeps domain handlers thin and pushes shared concerns (auth/session headers/env wiring) into one place [3][18].

[11] **Database Schema Topology (`packages/db/src/schema`)** - Drizzle schema modules define auth and SEO tables, including projects, integrations, chat, content draft/published records, task runs, and the strategy table family [1][12][13]. The strategy schema set (`strategy`, `strategy_phase`, `strategy_phase_content`, `strategy_snapshot`, `strategy_snapshot_content`) is already present with relations and typed insert/select/update schemas [13][15][18]. Indexes and soft-delete filtering conventions support query patterns used by operations and route handlers [12][14].

[12] **Database Operations Pattern** - Data access is intentionally centralized in `packages/db/src/operations/**`, exporting cohesive helpers and returning `ok/err/safe` results from `@rectangular-labs/result` [3][11][18]. Strategy operations expose list/get/details/create/update helpers plus phase and snapshot creation functions used by routes and workflows [13][14][15]. This pattern keeps SQL/Drizzle complexity out of app routes and enforces consistent error handling boundaries before converting failures to `ORPCError`s [9][10].

[13] **Strategy Domain Model** - Strategy is the current domain backbone: a long-lived strategy holds motivation and goal, phases model execution slices, phase-content links tie drafts/plans to work items, and snapshots capture aggregate/delta performance over time [11][14][15]. Status enums in schemas/parsers support suggestion-to-active lifecycle transitions and dismissal/observation states used by UI and workflows [14][18]. This model is codified in schema files and reflected in product routes (`.../strategies`) and onboarding components [4][6][23].

[14] **Strategy API Behaviors** - `packages/api-seo/src/routes/strategy.ts` implements CRUD/list/detail endpoints plus phase creation/update and validates organization ownership before mutations [9][10][13]. Creating a strategy or activating an existing one triggers task creation for `seo-start-strategy`, which starts asynchronous phase/content/snapshot provisioning [15][16]. This route is therefore both a data mutation surface and a workflow boundary, and regressions here directly affect strategy adoption UX [6][9][22].

[15] **Strategy Start Workflow (`strategy-start-workflow.ts`)** - The workflow loads project/strategy context, short-circuits when phases already exist, computes baseline metrics from GSC data, and creates phase/content/snapshot artifacts through DB operations [11][12][13]. It includes slug validation/normalization, conditional draft generation logic, aggregate/delta math, and AI-assisted suggestion shaping with JSON schema constrained output [16][18]. This file is a critical implementation node for strategy-first execution and should be updated with any schema or status lifecycle changes [14][23].

[16] **Task and Workflow Orchestration** - `packages/api-seo/src/routes/task.ts` abstracts provider differences and exposes unified task creation/status responses, mapping Trigger.dev and Cloudflare workflow states into a shared status contract [3][5][14]. Workflow bindings include planner, writer, onboarding, strategy suggestions, and strategy start; task polling routes resolve provider-specific execution details and outputs [9][15]. This layer decouples UI progress UX from execution backend choices while preserving typed outputs via core task schemas [6][18].

[17] **External Integrations** - Integration route modules (`integration.gsc`, `integration.github`, `integration.shopify`, webhook handlers) connect project data to external systems and feed content/strategy workflows [9][13][16]. `packages/google-apis` supplies GSC access used in strategy metrics gathering, while `packages/dataforseo` and other integration libraries support broader SEO signal ingestion [11][20]. Integration health and credential state are prerequisites for high-quality automation outcomes in onboarding and strategy execution [6][21].

[18] **Shared Schemas and Contracts (`packages/core`)** - `packages/core/src/schemas` holds ArkType schemas for task and strategy parsing, including cadence, statuses, snapshot types, and workflow IO contracts consumed by both API and workers [9][11][13]. This shared contract layer keeps validation and types synchronized across apps, routes, DB schema typing, and workflow implementations [3][15][16]. Architectural convention discourages ad-hoc casting and favors explicit schema-driven typing, making this package a key safety rail [2][22].

[19] **Shared UI/Auth/Content Packages** - `packages/ui`, `packages/auth`, and `packages/content` supply reusable front-end components, auth flows, and content/blog utilities across the three apps [4][6][7]. `auth` integrates with API context/session middleware, while `content` powers blog/docs surfaces in marketing apps [10][7]. Reuse through these packages prevents duplicate implementation logic and keeps app-specific routes focused on orchestration and presentation [2][5].

[20] **Background Tasks Package (`packages/task`)** - `packages/task` contains Trigger.dev and crawling/search helpers (`trigger/*`, `crawlers/*`, `lib/ai-tools/*`) and exposes client utilities used by API task status logic [5][16][17]. Its responsibilities include site understanding and SEO-related asynchronous jobs that complement Cloudflare workflow-based execution [3][21]. This package is part of the broader execution substrate and should stay consistent with task input/output schemas in `packages/core` [18][22].

[21] **Environment and Deployment Model** - Env variables are managed with dotenvx (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`), and app dev scripts decrypt env into local files before running Vite/TanStack Start [2][6][8]. Cloudflare Workers/Wrangler runtime assumptions are embedded in API/workflow code (`cloudflare:workers`, workflow bindings), and DB access expects local Docker-backed PostgreSQL during development [5][11]. Deploy/build paths (`build`, `build:preview`, `build:production`) should be reflected in operational docs and onboarding for contributors [22][23].

[22] **Quality and Testing Bar** - Repository policy requires running `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm format` after code changes, and these commands are orchestrated through Turbo at workspace scope [2][1]. Vitest is configured at the root with app-level test patterns, while package tests run via filtered workspace commands [6][20]. For any future architecture or workflow changes, update map nodes and add/adjust tests where behavior transitions are encoded (especially strategy and task status paths) [14][16][23].

[23] **Living Documentation and Evolution** - `strategy-architecture.md` captures the strategy-first design intent and remains the primary narrative reference for why schema/UI/workflow shifts are being made [13][15]. `AGENTS.md` mandates keeping `MIND_MAP.md` current, so architecture updates should include node edits and link rewiring in the same change set [1][22]. When implementation diverges from the strategy architecture doc, record the delta in this map and either update the design doc or annotate interim states here [11][24].

[24] **Current Gaps and Maintenance Notes** - This initial project map now exists but should be refined with commit-history nodes and subsystem deep dives when major refactors land, following the methodology in `PROJECT_MIND_MAPPING.md` [23][1]. Notable watch areas are strategy lifecycle edge cases, workflow idempotency, and alignment between marketing messaging (`apps/seo-www`) and implemented product capability (`apps/seo`) [8][14][15]. Any new top-level app/package or major routing/schema rewrite should trigger immediate updates to overview nodes [1-5] before adding specialized nodes [2][4][11].
